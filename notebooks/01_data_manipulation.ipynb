    "[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a widely-used open-source library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and tools for working with structured data. It popularized the term DataFrame as a data structure for statistical computing. In data science, pandas is used for: \n",
    "* **Data loading and writing**: reads from and writes to various file formats like CSV, Excel, JSON, and SQL databases\n",
    "* **Data cleaning and processing/preprocessing**: helps users with handling missing data, merging datasets, and reshaping data\n",
    "* **Data analysis**: performs grouping, aggregating, and statistical operations\n",

    "* Local file in various formats\n",

CPU processing will be responsible for acquiring data from APIs or Web Scraping. In most cases, network bandwidth will likely be the bottleneck. Furthermore, cuDF doesn't have a way to get transactions from SQL data bases directly into GPU memory. The recommended approach for reading data from a database is to first use CPU-based methods (i.e. pandas), then convert to cuDF for GPU-accelerated processing.  \n",
