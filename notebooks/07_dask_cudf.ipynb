    "**Portfolio Value**: Dask expertise demonstrates advanced understanding of distributed computing concepts that are increasingly valuable in enterprise data science environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to using multiple CPU cores or threads to execute computational graphs in parallel, Dask schedulers can also be configured to execute computational graphs on multiple CPUs, or, as we will do in this workshop, multiple GPUs. As a result, Dask programming facilitates operating on data sets that are larger than the memory of a single compute resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Dask computational graphs can consist of arbitrary Python code, they provide [a level of control and flexibility superior to many other systems](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html) that can operate on massive data sets. However, we will focus for this workshop primarily on the Dask DataFrame, one of several data structures whose operations and methods natively utilize Dask's parallel scheduling:\n",
    "* Dask DataFrame, which closely resembles the Pandas DataFrame\n",
    "* Dask Array, which closely resembles the NumPy ndarray\n",
    "* Dask Bag, a set which allows duplicates and can hold heterogeneously-typed data\n",

    "In particular, we will use a Dask-cuDF dataframe, which combines the interface of Dask with the GPU power of cuDF for distributed dataframe operations on multiple GPUs. We will now turn our attention to utilizing all 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs in this environment for operations on an 18GB UK population data set that would not fit into the memory of a single 16GB GPU."
