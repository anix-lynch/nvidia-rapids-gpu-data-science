    "\n",
    "In addition to using multiple CPU cores or threads to execute computational graphs in parallel, Dask schedulers can also be configured to execute computational graphs on multiple CPUs, or, as we will do in this workshop, multiple GPUs. As a result, Dask programming facilitates operating on data sets that are larger than the memory of a single compute resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Dask computational graphs can consist of arbitrary Python code, they provide [a level of control and flexibility superior to many other systems](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html) that can operate on massive data sets. However, we will focus for this workshop primarily on the Dask DataFrame, one of several data structures whose operations and methods natively utilize Dask's parallel scheduling:\n",
